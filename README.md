Exploratory Data Analysis: House Prices Dataset (Kaggle)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the House Prices dataset from Kaggle. The dataset focuses on predicting the final sale price of residential properties in Ames, Iowa, using 79 explanatory variables that detail a variety of physical, locational, and neighborhood features.

Project Objectives

The EDA aims to lay a solid groundwork for predictive modeling by focusing on the following objectives:
	1.	Understanding the Data
	â€¢	Explore the structure and types of variables.
	â€¢	Summarize statistics to build familiarity with the dataset.
	2.	Identifying Patterns
	â€¢	Discover key trends and relationships in the data that may influence house prices.
	3.	Detecting Anomalies
	â€¢	Locate and address inconsistencies or outliers that could impact model performance.
	4.	Generating Insights
	â€¢	Develop actionable insights for feature engineering and data preprocessing, essential for machine learning workflows.

Key Features of the Analysis

	â€¢	Data Overview
	â€¢	A comprehensive examination of the datasetâ€™s structure and variables.
	â€¢	Summary statistics and initial observations.
	â€¢	Visual Explorations
	â€¢	Visualizations to uncover trends, correlations, and potential drivers of house prices.
	â€¢	Outlier and Anomaly Detection
	â€¢	Identification of unusual patterns that may require attention before model development.
	â€¢	Actionable Insights
	â€¢	Recommendations for preparing the data for machine learning, including handling missing values and transforming variables.
