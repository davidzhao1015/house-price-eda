**Exploratory Data Analysis: House Prices Dataset (Kaggle)**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the [House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) from Kaggle. The dataset focuses on predicting the final sale price of residential properties in Ames, Iowa, using 79 explanatory variables that detail a variety of physical, locational, and neighborhood features.

**Project Objectives**

The EDA aims to lay a solid groundwork for predictive modeling by focusing on the following objectives:
1.	**Understanding the Data**: Explore the structure and types of variables. Summarize statistics to build familiarity with the dataset.
2.	**Identifying Patterns**: Discover key trends and relationships in the data that may influence house prices.
3.	**Detecting Anomalies**: Locate and address inconsistencies or outliers that could impact model performance.
4.	**Generating Insights**: Develop actionable insights for feature engineering and data preprocessing, essential for machine learning workflows.
